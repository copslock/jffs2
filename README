Python module for handling JFFS2
================================

This module reads in JFFS2 dirents and inodes. 

jffs2extract tool dumps the whole JFFS2 image contents to disk.

In order to have LZO support, you need to have python-lzo installed,
which does not seem to be available from pypi, but can be downloaded from
https://github.com/jd-boyd/python-lzo
